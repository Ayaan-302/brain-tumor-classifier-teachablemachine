# Brain Tumor Classifier using Teachable Machine

This repository showcases a machine learning project where a model was developed using **Teachable Machine** to classify brain tumors into three categories: **Glioma, Meningioma, and Pituitary Tumors**.

## Project Overview

- **Objective:** To build a machine learning model capable of classifying brain tumors from MRI images.
- **Tool Used:** Teachable Machine by Google
- **Model Functionality:** The model analyzes MRI images and classifies the tumor type.

## Features

- Simple and user-friendly interface.
- No coding required for model training.
- Fast and accurate tumor classification.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the provided Teachable Machine model link.
3. Upload an MRI image.
4. The model will predict whether the tumor is Glioma, Meningioma, or Pituitary.

## Dataset

- The dataset comprises labeled MRI images for each tumor type, ensuring accurate classification.

## Technologies Used

- Teachable Machine
- Machine Learning
- Image Classification
